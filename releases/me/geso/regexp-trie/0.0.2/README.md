## SYNOPSIS in GROOVY

	@GrabResolver(name='tokuhirom', root='https://tokuhirom.github.io/maven/releases/')
	@Grab('me.geso:regexp-trie:0.0.2')
	import me.geso.regexp_trie.RegexpTrie;

	def trie = new RegexpTrie();
	["foobar", "fooxar", "foozap", "fooza"].forEach {
		trie.add(it);
	}
	println(trie.regexp()) // → (?:foo(?:bar|xar|zap?))

## DESCRIPTION

This module generates regular expression from list of tokens.
It builds a trie-ized regexp as above.

You can only add plain strings into regular expression. You can't use meta characters in it. `a+b` is treated as `a\+b`, not "more than one a's followed by b".
