tokuhirom's maven repo
======================

This is a @tokuhirom's maven repo.
I'm using [camerick's method](http://cemerick.com/2010/08/24/hosting-maven-repos-on-github/) for creating maven repository. Maven central is too hard for me.

You can use this repository by following:

    <repositories>
        <repository>
            <id>tokuhirom</id>
            <url>https://tokuhirom.github.io/maven/releases/</url>
        </repository>
    </repositories>
